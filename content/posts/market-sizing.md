Market sizing is one of the most fundamental consulting skills. Here's my approach.

\## The Framework



I typically use a combination of \*\*top-down\*\* and \*\*bottom-up\*\* approaches.



\### Top-Down



Start with the total addressable market and narrow down:



Total Market → Segment → Geography → Target Customers



\### Bottom-Up



Build up from unit economics:



Price × Volume × Customers = Market Size



\## Key Principles



1\. \*\*Triangulate\*\* — Use multiple methods and cross-check

2\. \*\*Document assumptions\*\* — Make them explicit and defensible

3\. \*\*Sensitivity analysis\*\* — Test what happens if you're wrong



\## Example



In my recent project at Blackmont Consulting, I sized a £400M sector using:



\- Industry reports for top-down estimates

\- Customer interviews for bottom-up validation

\- Competitor analysis for market share assumptions



The result? Identified a £1.6B growth opportunity by 2030.
