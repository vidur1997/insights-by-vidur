platform_allocation = {
    platform: daily_budget * platform_weights[platform]
    for platform in selected_platforms
}
```

**Results:**

```
Campaign Setup Time     Reduced from hours to minutes
Platforms Supported     4 (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Google)

## Academic Research

### Geographic Concentration in Global Semiconductor Manufacturing

**MSc Dissertation** | University of Exeter | 2025-2026

**Research Question:**
Why have USD 95B in government subsidies failed to reduce geographic concentration in semiconductor manufacturing?

**Methodology:**

1. **Quantitative Analysis** — Trade flow data, production capacity metrics, and market share trends (2015-2024)

2. **Total Cost of Ownership Model** — Comparative analysis of manufacturing economics across US, Taiwan, and emerging regions

3. **Ecosystem Mapping** — Assessment of talent, supplier networks, and infrastructure dependencies

**Key Findings:**

```
METRIC                          VALUE
------                          -----
Global Market Size              USD 500B+
Taiwan Market Share             31%
US Manufacturing Cost Premium   +56% vs Taiwan
Government Subsidies (Global)   USD 95B+
Concentration Trend             Increasing despite subsidies
```

**Strategic Implications:**

- Subsidies alone cannot replicate ecosystem advantages (talent density, supplier proximity, infrastructure maturity)
- Geographic diversification requires 10-15 year horizon and sustained investment
- Supply chain risk remains elevated for advanced node manufacturing

**Skills Applied:** Python, SQL, Data Visualisation, Economic Analysis, Strategic Research
